# Classifying Keywords based on Search Intent

| Keyword | Search Intent |
|---------|---------------|
| [keyword1] | [intent1] |
| [keyword2] | [intent2] |
| [keyword3] | [intent3] |
| [keyword4] | [intent1] |
| [keyword5] | [intent2] |
| [keyword6] | [intent3] |
```

Please replace `[keyword]` with the actual keywords and `[intent]` with the respective search intent, which could be informational, commercial, or transactional,Also, make sure to fill in all the relevant keywords in the table.

To resolve the issue of ungrouped imports, you can organize your imports to enhance readability and maintainability,Here's the organized version of your imports:

```python
import subprocess
import time
import pyperclip

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains

import chromedriver_autoinstaller
```

Organizing your imports in this manner can help improve the readability of your code and comply with coding conventions.

Certainly, here's an example of how to use the `try` and `except` blocks in Python to handle exceptions:

```python
try:
    # This is the block of code where you anticipate an exception might occur
    dividend = int(input("Please enter the dividend: "))
    divisor = int(input("Please enter the divisor: "))
    result = dividend / divisor
    print(f"The result of the division is: {result}")

except ZeroDivisionError:
    # This block will execute if a ZeroDivisionError is raised
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

except ValueError:
    # This block will execute if a ValueError is raised (e.g., if the input cannot be converted to an integer)
    print("Error: Please enter valid integer values.")

except Exception as e:
    # This block will execute for any other unexpected exceptions
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

In this example, if the user enters invalid input or attempts to divide by zero, the appropriate exception block will be executed, providing an error message for the user.

The warning you're receiving, "Redefining name 'e' from the outer scope," indicates that you're using the variable name `e` in the except block, but it's already defined in an outer scope

The warning you're receiving, "Redefining name 'e' from the outer scope," indicates that you're using the variable name `e` in the except block, but it's already defined in an outer scope. You should avoid redefining variables from an outer scope within the inner scope. Here's a revised version of your code that avoids redefining the variable `e`:

```python
try:
    cancel = driver.find_element_by_css_selector('.se-popup-button.se-popup-button-cancel')
    if cancel:
        cancel.click()
except Exception as error:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {error}")
```

In this version, I have replaced the variable name `e` with `error` to prevent the redefinition warning. This should help to clarify the code and ensure it runs smoothly.

The warning you're encountering, "Anomalous backslash in string: '\ '. String constant might be missing an r prefix," is due to the usage of a backslash in the string without an 'r' prefix. This can happen if you're trying to escape a special character, but it's not being interpreted correctly. Here's a revised version of your code without the warning:

```python
def naver_login():
    # Navigate to the Naver login page
    driver.get(r'/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9223 --user-data-dir="~/ChromeProfile"')
    print("Navigating to the login page")
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

In this updated version, I've added the 'r' prefix before the string to indicate that it is a raw string. This helps to resolve the warning you were seeing.
