# **Real-Time Coin Price Update**
If you already have the `getUpbitCoinPrices` function imported from the `'../ts/upibtCoinRatingOrder'` file and you want to use it, you can simply call the function in your existing code without re-importing it. Here's how you can use the imported function:

```javascript
// Make sure you have already imported the function from the specified file

// Call the imported function in your script
getUpbitCoinPrices();
```

With this approach, you are directly using the function `getUpbitCoinPrices` that was previously imported from the `'../ts/upibtCoinRatingOrder'` file. This will execute the function and perform the necessary actions as defined in the imported file.
