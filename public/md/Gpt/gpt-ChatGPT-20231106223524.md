I understand that you want to parse the JSON data and display it using a loop since you don't know the values in advance. Here's a JavaScript code snippet that will parse the JSON data and dynamically create a Bootstrap-styled table with the provided financial data:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <title>Financial Report</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container mt-5">
    <table class="table">
      <thead class="thead-dark">
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">#</th>
          <th scope="col">KRW</th>
          <th scope="col">Jun 2023infoFiscal Q2 2023 ended 6/30/23.</th>
          <th scope="col">Y/Y change</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody id="financialTableBody">
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    // JSON data
    const jsonData = {
      "0": {
        "(KRW)": "RevenueThe total amount of income generated by the sale of goods or services related to the company's primary operations",
        "Jun 2023infoFiscal Q2 2023 ended 6/30/23.": "523.98B",
        "Y/Y change": "-12.12%"
      },
      "1": {
        "(KRW)": "Operating expenseRepresents the total incurred expenses through normal operations",
        "Jun 2023infoFiscal Q2 2023 ended 6/30/23.": "93.18B",
        "Y/Y change": "-3.78%"
      },
      "2": {
        "(KRW)": "Net incomeCompanyâs earnings for a period net of operating costs, taxes, and interest",
        "Jun 2023infoFiscal Q2 2023 ended 6/30/23.": "147.51B",
        "Y/Y change": "-19.58%"
      },
      "3": {
        "(KRW)": "Net profit marginMeasures how much net income or profit is generated as a percentage of revenue.",
        "Jun 2023infoFiscal Q2 2023 ended 6/30/23.": "28.15",
        "Y/Y change": "-8.49%"
      },
      "4": {
        "(KRW)": "Earnings per shareRepresents the company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock.",
        "Jun 2023infoFiscal Q2 2023 ended 6/30/23.": "1.03K",
        "Y/Y change": "-18.90%"
      },
      "5": {
        "(KRW)": "EBITDAEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a measure of a company's overall financial performance and is used as an alternative to net income in some circumstances",
        "Jun 2023infoFiscal Q2 2023 ended 6/30/23.": "239.49B",
        "Y/Y change": "-8.07%"
      },
      "6": {
        "(KRW)": "Effective tax rateThe percent of their income that a corporation pays in taxes",
        "Jun 2023infoFiscal Q2 2023 ended 6/30/23.": "20.47%",
        "Y/Y change": "â"
      }
    };

    const financialTableBody = document.getElementById("financialTableBody");

    for (const key in jsonData) {
      if (jsonData.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        const data = jsonData[key];
        const row = document.createElement("tr");
        row.innerHTML = `<th scope="row">${key}</th>`;
        for (const prop in data) {
          if (data.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
            row.innerHTML += `<td>${data[prop]}</td>`;
          }
        }
        financialTableBody.appendChild(row);
      }
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code will dynamically create a table based on the JSON data, allowing for flexibility when the values are not known in advance.
