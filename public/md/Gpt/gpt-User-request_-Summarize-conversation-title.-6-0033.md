Certainly! Let me explain the JavaScript code for adding new tasks to the to-do list step by step:javascriptCopy codeconst taskForm = document.getElementById("task-form");
const taskList = document.getElementById("task-list");
Here, we start by selecting two HTML elements using their id attributes:taskForm: This variable refers to the HTML form element with the id "task-form." This form is used for adding new tasks.taskList: This variable refers to the HTML unordered list element with the id "task-list." This list will display the tasks.javascriptCopy codetaskForm.addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const newTaskInput = document.getElementById("new-task");
    const taskText = newTaskInput.value;
We add an event listener to the form with the submit event. When the form is submitted (e.g., when the user clicks the "Add" button or presses Enter), the function inside the event listener is executed.e.preventDefault(): This line prevents the default behavior of form submission, which would typically refresh the page. We want to handle the submission with JavaScript to add tasks dynamically.const newTaskInput = document.getElementById("new-task");: This line selects the input element with the id "new-task." It's the input field where the user types a new task.const taskText = newTaskInput.value;: This line gets the value (text) entered by the user in the input field and stores it in the taskText variable.javascriptCopy codeif (taskText.trim() !== "") {
    const taskItem = document.createElement("li");
    taskItem.textContent = taskText;
    taskList.appendChild(taskItem);

    // Clear the input field
    newTaskInput.value = "";

    // Add a click event to remove the task when clicked
    taskItem.addEventListener("click", function () {
        taskList.removeChild(taskItem);
    });
}
Inside this conditional block, we check if the taskText is not empty. We use taskText.trim() to remove any leading or trailing spaces and then check if it's not an empty string.If the task text is not empty, we proceed to create a new list item (<li>) using document.createElement("li").We set the text content of the new task item to the taskText using taskItem.textContent = taskText;.The new task item is appended to the taskList using taskList.appendChild(taskItem);, adding it to the list of tasks.We clear the input field by setting its value to an empty string: newTaskInput.value = "";.Finally, we add a click event listener to the task item. When a task item is clicked, it is removed from the list.This code ensures that when the user submits a new task, it is added to the list, and if they click on a task, it is removed from the list.I hope this explanation clarifies how the code works!
