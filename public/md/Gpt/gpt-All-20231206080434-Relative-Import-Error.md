  It seems like you're facing an ImportError due to a relative import issue in your project. To resolve this, you can try the following:

1. Make sure your project has a proper structure with an appropriate package setup.

2. Ensure that there's an `__init__.py` file in each directory to indicate that it's a Python package.

Here's a modified directory structure example:

```plaintext
project/
|-- main.py
|-- app/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- newsdownload.py
|   |-- api.py
|-- requirements.txt
```

In your `main.py` or any other entry point file, you can then import as follows:

```python
from app.newsdownload import NewsDownload
```

This assumes that `main.py` is at the top level of your project directory.

If the issue persists, please provide more details about your project structure and import statements for further assistance.
