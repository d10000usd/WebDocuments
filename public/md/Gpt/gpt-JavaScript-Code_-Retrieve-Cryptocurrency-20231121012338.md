# **JavaScript Code: Retrieve Cryptocurrency**
</head>
<body>
<p>Sure, here's a JavaScript code snippet to retrieve the information for the first cryptocurrency (KRW-ELF) from the provided data:

```javascript
const data = {
    "KRW-ELF": {
        // ... (the rest of the object)
    },
    "KRW-BTC": {
        // ... (the rest of the object)
    }
};

const firstCrypto = data["KRW-ELF"];
console.log(firstCrypto);
```

This code uses the object key "KRW-ELF" to access the corresponding cryptocurrency's data within the provided JSON object. You can replace the `console.log` statement with any further processing or output you need for the first cryptocurrency.




</p>

<p>If you don't know the key and want to retrieve the data for the first cryptocurrency regardless of its key, you can use the `Object.values` method to get an array of the values in the object and then access the first element of that array. Here's the updated code:

```javascript
const data = {
    "KRW-ELF": {
        // ... (the rest of the object)
    },
    "KRW-BTC": {
        // ... (the rest of the object)
    }
};

const firstCrypto = Object.values(data)[0];
console.log(firstCrypto);
```

This code will give you the data for the first cryptocurrency in the object, regardless of its key.




</p>

<p>If you want to retrieve data for the first 5 cryptocurrencies, you can use the `Object.values` method along with array slicing. Here's the code:

```javascript
const data = {
    "KRW-ELF": {
        // ... (the rest of the object)
    },
    "KRW-BTC": {
        // ... (the rest of the object)
    },
    // Add more cryptocurrencies here...
};

const firstFiveCryptos = Object.values(data).slice(0, 5);
console.log(firstFiveCryptos);
```

This code will give you an array containing the data for the first 5 cryptocurrencies in the object, regardless of their keys. You can adjust the slicing parameters if you want a different number of cryptocurrencies.




</p>

<p>If you want to retrieve data for the last 5 cryptocurrencies, you can use the `Object.values` method along with array slicing. Here's the code:

```javascript
const data = {
    "KRW-ELF": {
        // ... (the rest of the object)
    },
    "KRW-BTC": {
        // ... (the rest of the object)
    },
    // Add more cryptocurrencies here...
};

const lastFiveCryptos = Object.values(data).slice(-5);
console.log(lastFiveCryptos);
```

This code will give you an array containing the data for the last 5 cryptocurrencies in the object, regardless of their keys. The use of `-5` in `slice(-5)` means that it will start from the fifth-to-last element and include all elements until the end. You can adjust the slicing parameters if you want a different number of cryptocurrencies from the end.
