The issue you are encountering is due to the absence of the `ChromeDriverManager` module in your code. It seems you are trying to use it without importing it properly. You need to include the necessary import statements at the beginning of your script. Add the following line to import `ChromeDriverManager`:

```python
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
```

Make sure you have the necessary packages installed by running:

```bash
pip install webdriver_manager
```

After making these adjustments, your code should work properly.
