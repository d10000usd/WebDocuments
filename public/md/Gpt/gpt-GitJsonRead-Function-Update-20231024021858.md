The warning message you're receiving is from Pylint, and it's advising you to explicitly specify the encoding when using the `open` function. This is considered good practice to ensure that the file is opened with the correct encoding, preventing any potential issues that might arise from using the default system encoding.

To address this warning, you can explicitly specify the encoding when opening the file. For example, if you know the file encoding is UTF-8, you can use the following:

```python
import yaml

def read_yaml_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    return data
```

By explicitly specifying the encoding as 'utf-8', you ensure that the file is opened and read using the correct character encoding, which is especially important for files that contain non-ASCII characters.
